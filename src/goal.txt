data:
- list of clients


main:
- setup master socket
- add master to fd_set
- loop (running):
	- copy fd_set to fd_set2
	- select on fd_set2
	- loop over returned sockets:
		- if socket == master socket:
			- accept client
			- add to list
		- else:
			- read available data
			- find client based on fd (better way?)
			- add to buffer
			- parse buffer
			- need more:
				- return & wait for next loop
			- done:
				- call route for response
				- send response
